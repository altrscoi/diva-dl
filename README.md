# diva-dl 🎙️

diva-dl is a one-script-python based downloader that specializes in acquiring audios from voice actor's on reddit (gwa, etc.). it scrapes a reddit profile to search for any soundgasm links posted by the account and automates the downloading process. it can also be used as a standalone soundgasm downloader.

## features
- multi-user & multi-threading support – download from multiple reddit va profiles at once
-  reddit thread parsing – automatically extracts soundgasm links from entire reddit threads, no manual searching needed
- organized downloads – files are neatly sorted by voice actor username, making it have a much nicer look
- live progress tracking – see successful vs failed downloads, real-time speed tracking, and automatic file size warnings for 2gb+ collections
- import from text files – if you have a list of reddit/soundgasm links in a text file, diva has the ability to download them
- safe termination handling – diva gracefully finishes current downloads instead of corrupting files
- customizable settings – toggle multi-threading, verbosity, file size warnings, and more to fine-tune your experience
- beautiful ui with rich – styled with spinners, progress bars, live updates, and a modern CLI experience

## Disclaimer

i designed diva-dl for a friend and released it out of request. i spent a very long time squashing bugs before this release. before you open an issue in the issue tracker, please make sure it's nothing on your part. i don't plan on updating this project much more as i feel it's pretty complete hehe

please respect any voice actors' wishes that have rules in place against archiving their audios. diva-dl is meant to download publicly avaliable audios and not infringe on anyones privacy :) nonetheless, i am not responsible for what you do with this script.
